# Dinha
Is your `downloads` folder full of **useless files**, downloaded a long time ago, but you don't have the enough time or courage to delete them? Dinha can help you manage that wasted space in you storage ðŸª„

It's very simple, you can indicate which folders Dinha will keep an eye on for you, set an expiration date and you will be notified which files you don't use a lot of time and should delete them ðŸ§™
